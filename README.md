# bitmap-transformer

Teammate: Crystal Soo Lee

*Description*

Build a bitmap (.bmp) transformer CLI that will read a bitmap from a disk. Run one or more color or raster transforms and then write it out to a new file. This project will require manipulating binary data. The solution should be composed of small tested methods that solve specific problems.

*Methods*

Create a Bitmap class, with a constructor and an instance method to write out image data and create a Bitmap object in the main method and write it out to a different filename (still with hardcoded strings). Write a single transform method. Call that method in the main method. Add a second transform, maybe getting fancier.
